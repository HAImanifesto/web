*A new authorship paradigm*

We are entering an era where creative work is no longer made by humans alone.  
Artificial systems can now assist in writing, designing, composing, analyzing.  
But the presence of a machine does not erase the presence of the human.  
And the act of creation is not only about output — it is about authorship.

*HAI/ — Human / Artificial Intelligence — marks a new model of authorship.*


***This Manifesto is a proposal for a practical framework of signaling and recognizing the collaborative authorship between Human & Artificial Intelligence.*** 
 

This is a new paradigm where machines may contribute,
but the human remains the source of intention, judgment, and responsibility.

This model rests on simple but important principles:

- **Human authorship is not optional.** It must be preserved, named, and visible.  
- **AI contributions must be transparent.** We have a right to know how something was made.  
- **Collaboration is layered.** HAI/ makes space for shared processes, without confusion about origin.
- **Responsibility stays with people.** Decisions, interpretations, and impacts are human matters.

We use AI not to outsource creativity, but to support it.  

This is a foundation.  
A way to stay oriented  
as authorship evolves  
and new forms of intelligence emerge.

This is a classification system used to indicate the degree of AI involvement in the creation of a work — from fully human-made to fully machine-generated — with clear levels reflecting the balance of authorship.
