*A new authorship paradigm*

We are entering an era where creative work is no longer made by humans alone.  
Artificial systems can now assist in writing, designing, composing, analyzing.  
But the presence of a machine does not erase the presence of the human.  
And the act of creation is not only about output — it is about authorship.

*HAI/ — Human / Artificial Intelligence — marks a new model of authorship.*


***This Manifesto is a proposal for a practical framework of signaling and recognizing the collaborative authorship between Human & Artificial Intelligence.***


It is an invitation — for creators across disciplines to declare their use of AI tools with transparency, and for publishers, platforms, and audiences to recognize and appreciate the added value that responsible co-authorship can bring.

The HAI/score offers a simple way to indicate the degree and nature of collaboration between human and artificial intelligence in the creation process.

The meaning of the score is always contextual. Some situations — such as personal expression or educational evaluation — may call for minimal AI involvement. Others — such as technical, scientific, or analytical work — may benefit from more substantial support, especially when accuracy, consistency, or scale are priorities.

This framework is based on the acknowledgment that machines may contribute, but the human remains the source of intention, judgment, and responsibility — a foundation that gives rise to the following key principles:

- **Human authorship is not optional.** It must be preserved, named, and visible.  
- **AI contributions must be transparent.** We have a right to know how something was made.  
- **Collaboration is layered.** HAI/ makes space for shared processes, without confusion about origin.
- **Responsibility stays with people.** Decisions, interpretations, and impacts are human matters.

This is a foundation.  
A way to stay oriented   
as authorship evolves 
and new forms of intelligence 
emerge.


<h2 class="title">The HAI/score</h2>

This is a classification system used to indicate the degree of AI involvement in the creation of a work — from fully human-made to fully machine-generated — with clear levels reflecting the balance of authorship.

## HAI/ Authorship Attribution Scale  

| **Level** | **HI Involvement** | **AI Involvement** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **HAI/0** | The human does everything: originates the idea, creates the structure, writes the text, and refines it. | No AI used at any stage. | **Fully human-authored.** No digital assistance beyond basic tools like typing. |
| **HAI/1** | The human writes the full text and provides the ideas and structure. | AI performs minor spelling and grammar corrections. | **AI as proofreader.** No influence on content, tone, or meaning. |
| **HAI/2** | The human writes the full text and brings the ideas. | AI offers light suggestions: detects inconsistencies, recommends clarifications. | **AI as verifier.** Supports human thinking without reshaping the work. |
| **HAI/3** | The human writes the content and defines the message. | AI helps rewrite parts: improves clarity, style, tone, or phrasing. | **AI as stylist.** Refines the form without altering substance. |
| **HAI/4** | The human provides the core idea or thesis. | AI proposes an outline, organizes sections, and suggests structural flow. | **AI as architect.** Shapes the framework based on human intent. |
| **HAI/5** | The human provides a core concept, question, or goal. | AI generates the outline and drafts substantial portions of the content. | **AI as co-author.** Produces prose under human direction. |
| **HAI/6** | The human inputs a prompt, keywords, or theme. | AI independently generates the structure and full draft content. | **AI as autonomous drafter.** Human provides only creative spark. |
| **HAI/7** | The human defines the objective and may give brief feedback. | AI produces, revises, and refines multiple drafts with minimal human input. | **AI as lead author.** Human curates or selects among AI-generated versions. |
| **HAI/8** | The human provides a general topic or intent to publish. | AI invents the ideas, structure, and writing entirely, including revisions. | **AI as sole creator.** Human involvement is passive or distant. |
| **HAI/9** | No human creative input whatsoever. | AI originates the idea, generates the full work, and performs all refinement steps. | **Fully AI-authored.** Human merely triggers or uploads the result. |
