*A New Creative Paradigm for Human / Artificial Intelligence*


This is a foundation.\
A way to stay oriented\
as authorship evolves and\
new forms of intelligence emerge.

We are entering an era where creative work is no longer made by humans alone.  
Artificial systems can now assist in writing, designing, composing, analyzing.  
But the presence of a machine does not erase the presence of the human.  
And the act of creation is not only about output — it is about authorship.

## HAI/ Framework

The HAI/ Framework provides a method for identifying, classifying, and communicating the involvement of artificial intelligence in the creation of a work.

Its goal is to make the degree of human–AI collaboration visible and understandable — both for those who create content and for those who evaluate, publish, or experience it.

It encourages creators to clearly state how AI tools were used, and invites publishers, institutions, and audiences to appreciate this transparency not only as context, but as something that enriches the authenticity, clarity, and meaning of the work itself.

The framework does not prescribe how AI should be used.
It offers a structure for describing that use — openly, responsibly, and in context. 

## HAI/ Principles

This framework is based on the acknowledgment that machines may contribute, but the human remains the source of intention, judgment, and responsibility — a foundation that gives rise to the following key principles:

- **Human authorship is not optional.** It must be preserved, named, and visible.  
- **AI contributions must be transparent.** We have a right to know how something was made.  
- **Collaboration is layered.** HAI/ makes space for shared processes, without confusion about origin.
- **Responsibility stays with people.** Decisions, interpretations, and impacts are human matters.


## HAI/ Score

The HAI/ Score is a classification system that signals the degree and nature of AI involvement in the creation of a work — from fully human-made to fully machine-generated — with distinct levels reflecting the balance of authorship.

The meaning of the score is always contextual. Some situations — such as personal expression or educational evaluation — may call for minimal AI involvement. Others — such as technical, scientific, or analytical work — may benefit from more substantial support, especially when accuracy, consistency, or scale are priorities.


## HAI/ Scale  

| **Level** | **HI Involvement** | **AI Involvement** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **HAI/0** | The human does everything: originates the idea, creates the structure, writes the text, and refines it. | No AI used at any stage. | **Fully human-authored.** No digital assistance beyond basic tools like typing. |
| **HAI/1** | The human writes the full text and provides the ideas and structure. | AI performs minor spelling and grammar corrections. | **AI as proofreader.** No influence on content, tone, or meaning. |
| **HAI/2** | The human writes the full text and brings the ideas. | AI offers light suggestions: detects inconsistencies, recommends clarifications. | **AI as verifier.** Supports human thinking without reshaping the work. |
| **HAI/3** | The human writes the content and defines the message. | AI helps rewrite parts: improves clarity, style, tone, or phrasing. | **AI as stylist.** Refines the form without altering substance. |
| **HAI/4** | The human provides the core idea or thesis. | AI proposes an outline, organizes sections, and suggests structural flow. | **AI as architect.** Shapes the framework based on human intent. |
| **HAI/5** | The human provides a core concept, question, or goal. | AI generates the outline and drafts substantial portions of the content. | **AI as co-author.** Produces prose under human direction. |
| **HAI/6** | The human inputs a prompt, keywords, or theme. | AI independently generates the structure and full draft content. | **AI as autonomous drafter.** Human provides only creative spark. |
| **HAI/7** | The human defines the objective and may give brief feedback. | AI produces, revises, and refines multiple drafts with minimal human input. | **AI as lead author.** Human curates or selects among AI-generated versions. |
| **HAI/8** | The human provides a general topic or intent to publish. | AI invents the ideas, structure, and writing entirely, including revisions. | **AI as sole creator.** Human involvement is passive or distant. |
| **HAI/9** | No human creative input whatsoever. | AI originates the idea, generates the full work, and performs all refinement steps. | **Fully AI-authored.** Human merely triggers or uploads the result. |
