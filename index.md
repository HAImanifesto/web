# The HAI Manifesto

## A new authorship paradigm

We are entering an era where creative work is no longer made by humans alone. 
Artificial systems can now assist in writing, designing, composing, analyzing. 
But the presence of a machine does not erase the presence of the human. 
And the act of creation is not only about output — it is about authorship.

HAI — Human & Artificial Intelligence — marks a new model of authorship.

One where machines may contribute, but the human remains the source of intention, judgment, and responsibility.

**This model rests on simple but important principles:**

- **a)** Human authorship is not optional. It must be preserved, named, and visible.
- **b)** AI contributions must be transparent. We have a right to know how something was made.
- **c)** Collaboration is layered. HAI makes space for shared processes, without confusion about origin.
- **d)** Responsibility stays with people. Decisions, interpretations, and impacts are human matters.

We use AI not to outsource creativity, but to support it.
We choose tools that reveal, not conceal.
We embrace complexity — not to mystify, but to understand.
This is a foundation.
Not a limit, but a lens.
A way to stay oriented as authorship evolves and new forms of intelligence emerge.
